### Trinket attempt 1
Turtle becomes a lowercase 'b'
Would help to understand how the turtle is orientated, an origin point and a grid? The pumpkin was kinda hit and miss with changing sizes and adding fangs
```
import turtle
import random

turtle.shape("turtle")
turtle.speed(2)
turtle.pendown()
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.begin_fill()
turtle.circle(50)
turtle.circle('#%06x' % random.randint(0, 2**24 - 1))
turtle.end_fill()
```

### Maker's schedule, Manager's schedule - Paul Graham [^1].
```
Graham's mentality of 'Maker vs. Manager' doesn't address the importance of collaboration between the two parties. Whilst he states there is merit in both approaches, he is biased towards the maker's schedule. Dynamic workspaces with effective and empathetic leadership and both parties understanding the value of the other i.e. a change in mindset can be more effective (not necessarily a compromise).
