TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

try and except only

if, elif and else statements work together

Value Error works instead of Exception but the test didn't like it

Lecture Recap:

boolean question 'in' e.g. 5 in [1, 2, 3]
'try/except' catches errors, if your code doesn't work it doesn't break but reroutes to produce something e.g. print (you did a dumb)
'try/except/finally'

Open data project
interesting dataset to question and answer, what is found and how I got there?

f-strings - calling functions and building on with previous definitions
f"{shout(a.string)}!"
Check the cheatsheet, it helps make numbers more manageable
more readable and robust, extra layer of control

exercise 2:
Script is understanding that integers, doesn't fail when you enter a number outside the bounds, could add another later that says 'out of bounds'
Breaks when floating numbers are input
Breaks when strings are input
Incorrect input in first part still goes ok then,... but then it breaks

insert pxl photograph of exercise 2 mapping?
